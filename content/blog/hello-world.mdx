# Welcome to my blog

This is my first blog post using MDX. MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your Markdown documents.

## Features

- Support for **bold** and *italic* text
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Import and use React components
- And much more!

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
